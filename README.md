# Azure Billing Records Cost Optimization (Serverless Architecture)

## 🚀 Objective

Optimize storage costs in a serverless Azure environment for a **read-heavy** billing system using **Azure Cosmos DB** and **Blob Storage**, while meeting the following requirements:

- ❌ No changes to the existing API contracts
- 🔒 No data loss or downtime
- 👁️‍🗨️ Preserve read access to archived records
- 🧩 Maintain simplicity and ease of implementation

##🔧 Components
Component	Purpose
Azure Cosmos DB	Stores recent billing records (< 3 months)
Azure Blob Storage (Cool Tier)	Archives billing records older than 3 months
Azure Function (Timer Trigger)	Periodically archives old records to Blob Storage
Azure Function (HTTP Trigger)	Acts as a read proxy, falls back to Blob if needed
API Layer	Remains unchanged (no contract or interface change)

💡 Cost Optimization Strategy
Recent records (< 90 days) stay in Cosmos DB for fast reads.

Older records are archived to Blob Storage as JSON files.

A read proxy Azure Function:

Tries to fetch from Cosmos DB first

Falls back to Blob Storage if record is not found

A scheduled archival function:

Runs daily or weekly

Moves data older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Blob

🧪 Edge Case Handling
Edge Case	Solution
Race conditions	Use time-based cutoffs instead of flags or status fields
Large record sizes	Optionally compress data before writing to Blob
Blob read latency	Consider Azure CDN or caching layer for archived reads
Missing blobs	Gracefully return 404 or implement retry logic

🚀 Deployment Steps
Deploy Azure Cosmos DB and Blob Storage (Cool Tier)

Deploy both Azure Functions (Timer + HTTP Trigger) via:

Azure Portal or

Azure Functions Core Tools / Bicep / Terraform

Schedule the archival function (Timer Trigger)

Enable logging and monitoring using Azure Application Insights

📎 Notes
✅ Blob Storage (Cool Tier) offers significantly cheaper long-term storage compared to Cosmos DB RU/s pricing

🧠 This architecture enables scalable and affordable growth while ensuring no data loss or API changes

⚡ Archived data access may have slightly higher latency, but is acceptable for infrequent reads
